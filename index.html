            <p> I’m an UX/UI designer who specializes in more then just graphic design, I’m also an artist! This is a portfolio of both of my passions and my growth in both subjects. I love having creative reign over projects, its my favorite aspect of anything I work on.My skills include but aren’t limited to Figma, Procreate, CodePen, and am currently working on getting used to Procreate Dream. </p>
